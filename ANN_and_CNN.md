#ANN
=> Artificial neural networks  it is collection of layers consisto neurons and actiavtion functions which try to learn the pattern from data using foward and backwar propagation 
=>So i have implemented the ANN usng tensor flow with a mnist data set 
=>what i did ??
   =>load the data then normalized the data(0-1) for faster computation 
   =>converted y_train data to the n_dim vector so that it matches the o/p of our model (Ohe)
   =>create a model in which i have made 3 hidden layers with 1 o/p layer i have used activation function as relu max(0,x) , and for o/p softmax(gives the probalities     for all classes likely to belong )
=>model architecture 
    input =>flatten()=>hidden layer => o/p layer =>o/p 
    accuracy acheived arround 98% trained with 5 epochs (5 fp and bp)

CNN
 =>while using ANN i have faced 2 major issues not in mnsit but in 3d datasets one was high computaionl time and loss of spatial structural peoperties so to resolve i used CNN
 => convlution neural networks  Architecture 
 =>i/p image => kernal (matrix (nxn)) slides through the image =>creates a feature_map 
 =>in this process it learns the data from the image 

 =>SO i have tried CNN in MNSIT DATA SET 
  =>model archietcure
     2CNN layer =Max_pooling =>2CNN layer =>Max pooling =>flatten()=>ANN
     achieved accuracy of 99.5%

what all i learnt 
  =>why do we use CNN over ANN (not specificalaly in hands on )
  =>how to handle dataset for differn neural models ANN excepts (1d data) wheras CNN accepts (rgb format data )
  =>building model
